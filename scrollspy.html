                A long way above the plants, at the top of Pig’s legs, there was a long tail.
                “I don’t believe I have ever seen a pig with such a long neck,” laughed Rosemary. “Have you ever seen a pig with such a long neck?” Rosemary asked Basil.	
                “I think Pig’s front legs are longer than the back legs,” said Basil, ignoring the sisters.	
                “Don’t be silly, why would a pig want longer front legs?” The sisters demanded.	
                The plants were still talking about this, when a very long dribble landed in the flowerpot.	
                Pig, the giraffe, lowered his long neck and thought, “I hope they taste as good as they look.”	
                He wrote me a long letter.	
                I wrote a long letter to her.
